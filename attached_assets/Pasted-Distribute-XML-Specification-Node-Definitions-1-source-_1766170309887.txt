XML Feed Requirements
1. CDATA Usage: Enclose all job content in CDATA sections to better handle special
characters.
2. Incremental Updates: Include all open jobs in each feed submission. Exclude jobs no
longer open, as they will be removed from search results.
3. Unique Reference Numbers: Use unique <referencenumber> values for each job to
ensure accurate identification.
4. Publication Date: Use <date> to specify when the job was first made public.
Acceptable & Fair Usage Policies
1. Permanent URLs: Ensure each <url> is a direct link to the job description without login
or payment requirements. A login may be required for the application process.
2. Original Jobs Only: Include jobs unique to your website, avoiding postings from other
job boards or companies.
3. No Expired Jobs: Only include active, open jobs in your feed.
4. Reactivation Process: Contact support if your feed becomes inactive for any reason.
Encoding & Character Handling
1. Encoding Specification: Ensure correct encoding (UTF-8) is specified in the XML
header to avoid character issues.
PLEASE NOTE: We can use almost any feed with these values. The naming structure
does not have to match if the data is present for correct functionality.
Please contact us at hello@dstribute.io if you have any questions or require additional
information.
