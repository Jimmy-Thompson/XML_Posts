Deliveries typically take 30 minutes and are most frequent between 9 AM and 2 PM, though routes are available from 6 AM to 9 PM, seven days a week.

Responsibilities
- Pick up and deliver food or other items promptly and professionally
- Transport orders safely and maintain quality during delivery
- Set up orders at customer locations when requested (light setup only)
